## Global settings affect all services
global:
  ## Whether to used the combined db - if this is true all the databases used
  ## by magda will be consolidated into a single pod. If it's false, they'll
  ## all run in separate pods unless some managed postgres solution (e.g.
  ## useCloudSql) is specified elsewhere.
  ## Running in separate pods scales better, but requires more resources
  useCombinedDb: false

  ## Whether to use the Google Cloud SQL managed postgres solution. Only set
  ## this to true if you already have cloud sql set up and be sure to look at
  ## settings for the cloud-sql-proxy service below.
  useCloudSql: true

  ## The external URL of the installation, e.g. "https://search.data.gov.au".
  ## This is used in a number of places, including linking back to the site
  ## from emails, creating a absolute sitemap URL for robots.txt, etc.
  externalUrl: https://agriculture.magda.io

  ## How to handle rolling updates during a deployment. If set to 0, kubernetes
  ## will happily take down pods while it replaces them (useful for dev setups).
  ## If set to 1, kubernetes will make sure one pod is available to take requests
  ## during upgrades. 0 by default.
  # rollingUpdate:
  #   maxUnavailable: 0

  # image:
    ## What tag of the magda images to get. Look at
    ## for versions. https://github.com/magda-io/magda/releases/latest.
    ## By default this is the same version as the helm chart.
    ## tag: 0.0.49-RC3
    ## The docker repository to get the images from - defaults to the official
    ## data61 docker hub repo
    # repository: data61
    ## The imagePullPolicy to use for images - generally unless you're actively
    ## trying to track development this should be "IfNotPresent", otherwise if
    ## you are it can be "Always". Defaults to "IfNotPresent"
    # pullPolicy: Always
    ## Kubernetes secret to use if you're fetching images from a private repository
    # imagePullSecret: ""

  ## Whether to expose the node ports of the pods in the cluster - useful for
  ## development, because it allows you to connect directly to pods without using
  ## kubectl proxy
  # exposeNodePorts: false

  ## Whether to enable kubernetes liveness probes - these continually hit pods in
  ## order to see whether they're still alive and restart them upon too many failures.
  ## This is essential for prod, but tends to create a lot of overhead in development
  enableLivenessProbes: true

  ## The admin to use as the root admin user in the database. Defaults to the very first
  ## uuidv4
  # defaultAdminUserId: "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000"

  ## Default log level to use across the project. Currently this only affects scala-based
  ## services
  # logLevel: INFO

  ## Whether to disable database authentication - useful in development, a very very bad
  ## idea in production
  # noDbAuth: false
  
  ## Whether to give the pods priority classes - these ensure that essential pods like
  ## ElasticSearch, Databases and the Gateway are schedules ahead of less essential pods
  ## like minions, but tend to cause problems if you're running Magda over multiple
  ## namespaces. Make sure that the priorities tag is true if you turn this on.
  # enablePriorityClass: true

## Tags allow for services to be turned on and off on the fly... e.g. if you don't need
## to send emails, turn the correspondence-api off
tags:
  ## "all" is a shortcut which turns on all services except minions.
  all: false

  ## General services. Note that if you are using combined-db, you need to set both
  ## combined-db and the databases that you are using (e.g. authorization-db) to true.
  ## You can find explanations of what each of these are below

  admin-api: true
  apidocs-server: true
  authorization-api: true
  authorization-db: true
  cloud-sql-proxy: true
  combined-db: true
  content-db: true
  content-api: true
  correspondence-api: true
  elasticsearch: true
  gateway: true
  indexer: true
  preview-map: true
  registry-api: true
  registry-db: true
  search-api: true
  session-db: true
  web-server: true
  opa: true
  connectors: true

  ## Whether to use an ingress, which is necessary for HTTPS and using the Google CDN with
  ## Google Kubernetes Engine. By default this is off, and access is provided to the cluster
  ## through a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service
  ingress: true

  ## Priority classes - see explanation under "enablePriorityClasses" above
  # priorities: true

  ## Minions, which listen to changes in the registry and add extra metadata
  minion-broken-link: false
  minion-linked-data-rating: false
  minion-visualization: true
  minion-format: true

## These are the external jobs that pull data in from other data portals. A default is provided here for you.
connectors:
  ## Whether to run an initial job to crawl all these on install
  includeInitialJobs: false
  
  ## Whether to run recurring jobs on the schedule specified per connector.
  includeCronJobs: true

  config:
    - image:
        name: magda-ckan-connector
      id: abares
      name: data.gov.au - abares
      sourceUrl: https://data.gov.au/data/
      pageSize: 1000
      schedule: 0 * * * *
      allowedOrganisationNames: 
        - abares

  ## They can also have their resource requirements customised individually as per
  ## https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/ like so:
  # resources:
    # requests:
      # cpu: 0m
      # memory: 0Mi
    # limits:
      # cpu: 0m
      # memory: 0Mi

  ## You can also set image details (except name) for all connectors at this level - this will override
  ## what's in .global but be overridden by what's in the individual connector config.
  # image:
    # tag: vx.x.x
    # pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    # imagePullSecret: ""


      ## CKAN-only: Only get datasets that match this organisation name - you can only have one due to limitations
      ## in the CKAN API, if you need multiple organisations make multiple connectors.
      #allowedOrganisationName: "doee"

      ## Extra data that will be added to the 'source' aspect
      # extras:
      #   a: 122
      #   b:
      #     - 1

      ## Extra data that will be merged into the aspects that are recieved from the connector
      # presetRecordAspects:
      #   - id: "dcat-dataset-strings"
      #     recordType: "dataset"
      #     data:
      #       creation:
      #         isOpenData: true

## Settings for the ingress. You need one of these if you want to do SSL or use the Google CDN on GKE
## Otherwise using the built-in Kubernetes LoadBalancer works ok.
ingress:
  ## The hostname of the site
  hostname: agriculture.magda.io
  ## The name of the external ip to use - used when using the GCE ingress type
  ipName: magda-agriculture-prod
  ## The class of the ingress - if running on GKE, gce will automatically work, otherwise you
  ## can use "nginx" which requires extra setup
  ingressClass: gce
  ## Whether to enable TLS - requires a TLS secret to be set:
  ## https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/
  enableTls: true
  ## Name of the tls secret, defaults to "magda-cert-tls"
  tlsSecretName: "magda-cert-tls"
  ## Domains to attempt to obtain an SSL certificate for from let's encrypt, if using certmanager
  ## (requires extra setup)
  domains:
    - agriculture.magda.io

## Below are individual settings for services. All services can be customised as follows:
# servicename:
  ## The number of replicas to run
  # replicas: 1

  ## The service's image as per the global options under "global.image" like so:
  # image:
    # tag: vx.x.x
    # pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    # imagePullSecret: ""

  ## They can also have their resource requirements customised individually as per
  ## https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/ like so:
  # resources:
    # requests:
      # cpu: 0m
      # memory: 0Mi
    # limits:
      # cpu: 0m
      # memory: 0Mi

## Furthermore, all the stateful sets (elasticsearch.data and anything ending in -db) can
## have the volume that they claim customised like so:
# databasename-db:
  # data:
    ## The amount of storage to allocate - be generous because it's often not easy to resize
    # storage: 200Gi
    ## The storage class - needs to correspond to a storage class configured in kubernetes
    # storageClass: "ssd"

## Database pods (anything ending in -db) can also be configured with streaming backups via
## WAL-E (https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e)
# databasename-db:
  # waleBackup:
    ## The method to use for backup - either set to WAL (write-ahead-log) or leave blank
    ## for no backups
    # method: WAL

    ## The time (in the server's timezone) to do a full backup of the system
    # executionTime: 03:00

    ## Whether to only read backups but not write them
    # readOnly: false

    ## The WAL-E recovery mode to use - generally leave this out, or set to "immediate" for
    ## the quickest possible recovery at the expense of some data loss
    # recoveryMode:

    ## Settings for pushing backups to Google Storage
    ## The prefix of the place to push the backups
    # gsPrefix: "gs://magda-postgres-backups-asia/dev"

    ## Credentials for authenticating
    # googleApplicationCreds:
    ## The secret to look for the credentials json file in
    #   secretName: storage-account-credentials
    ## The filename of the credentials json mounted in the secret
    #   fileName: TerriaJS-5e042b649f8a.json

## Settings for the apidocs server, which serves the documentation for the api from
## /api/v0/apidocs/index.html
# apidoc-server:

## Settings for the authorization-api, which determines what each user's permissions are:
# authorization-api:

## Settings for the authorization-db, which serves the authorization-api
# authorization-db:

## A pod for proxying to Google Cloud SQL, the GCE managed database service.
cloud-sql-proxy:
  ## The cloud sql instance to connect to
  instanceConnectionName: magda-agriculture:australia-southeast1:agriculture-prod

## A pod that combines all the databases if global.useCombinedDb is set to true
# combined-db:

## A pod that controls the content in magda's UI
# content-api:

## The database behind content-api
# content-db:

## A service that renders emails and forwards them to an SMTP server
correspondence-api:
  ## The default recipient to email when there's no other choice - e.g. when asking a
  ## question about a dataset for which there's no organisational email
  defaultRecipient: "contact@magda.io"

  ## The hostname of the SMTP server to use - the password should be in a secret
  smtpHostname: "smtp.mailgun.org"

  ## The SMTP port to use - beware, default SMTP ports are blocked on most cloud
  ## providers
  smtpPort: 2525

## The elasticsearch setup - this can consist of up to three different kinds of pods -
## data nodes, master nodes and client nodes.
# elasticsearch:
  ## Whether to use client and master nodes, or just use data nodes.
  # production: false

  ## All three kinds of nodes can be customised with these settings like so:
  # nodetype:
    ## The java heap size - this should be half the total memory request
    # heapSize: 3000m
    ## Elasticsearch plugins to install
    # pluginsInstall: "repository-gcs"

  ## Settings for the data nodes - this is a statefulset that actually holds the data,
  ## and is the only kind of node that's strictly necessary. You can have multiple
  ## replicas of these, they will discover each other and balance shards and replicas
  ## between them.
  # data:

  ## Settings for the client nodes - this accepts HTTP connections from search-api and
  ## indexer and forwards them to the data nodes.
  # client:

  ## Settings for the master nodes - these keep track of the data nodes as they go up
  ## and down and keep track of what the current state of the data should be.
  # master:

## The gateway accepts incoming connections and directs them to the appropriate api pod,
## or the web server pod
gateway:
  service:
    ## The type of kubernetes service to use for the gateway - set to LoadBalancer to
    ## expose an external IP, or leave blank if using an ingress
    type: NodePort

    ## If using a LoadBalancer, the IP to try to use. Leave unset to get an automatic one
    # loadBalancerIP:
  auth:
    ckanAuthenticationUrl: https://data.gov.au/data
    vanguardWsFedIdpUrl: https://authentication.business.gov.au/fas/v2/wsfed12/authenticate
    vanguardWsFedRealm: https://agriculture.magda.io/vanguard

  ## If replacing a CKAN installation with Magda, this will redirect CKAN paths without
  ## direct magda equivalents (e.g. the API) to a ckan installation at this domain and path
  # enableCkanRedirection: true
  # ckanRedirectionDomain: "example.com"
  # ckanRedirectionPath: "/data"

  ## Configure the autoscaler
  # autoscaler:
    ## whether to enable autoscaling
    # enabled: false
    ## The minimum number of replicas to have
    # minReplicas: 2
    ## The maximum number of replicas to have
    # maxReplicas: 4

  ## Client ids to use for OAuth authentication
  # auth:
    ## Client id for facebook
    # facebookClientId: ""
    ## Client id for google
    # googleClientId: ""
    ## If you want to use ckan as a way to login, put the base URL here
    # ckanAuthenticationUrl: https://example.com
    ## If you want to use the Australian Department of Industry's VANguard service, put the details here:
    # vanguardWsFedIdpUrl: https://authentication.business.gov.au/fas/v2/wsfed12/authenticate
    # vanguardWsFedRealm: your-realm-here

## Configures the service that puts datasets and organisations into elasticsearch
# indexer:
  # elasticsearch:
    ## How many shards and replicas to use when creating a new index. Generally, more

  ## The registry api is able to be split into two kinds of deployments: full, which does everything
  ## but can only ever run one pod at a time, and read-only, which can only do read-only requests but
  ## is stateless and can be horizontally scaled
  # deployments:
  #   full:

    # readOnly:
      ## Whether to enable the read-only deployment - if not all traffic will go to the full deployment,
